# civworks-policy

The purpose of this repo is to develop policy documents and draft legislation collaboratively, with branching and related layers of detail.  This way people can go in different directions on the same policy document and later try to merge them into an agreed whole.

Contributions welcome.

Please keep discussions concrete and involved with specific changes you would like to see.  Ranting is understandable, but not here, because we want to keep this repo dedicated to the creation of policy language.

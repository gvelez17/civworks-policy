# civworks-policy

civ.works does not have specific policy positions, but provides a platform for broad participation in the formation of policy and law.

If you don't like a policy in this repo, you can do something about it:

   - make your own version (a "branch") and change the policy however you want
   
   - submit your changes back to the original (a "pull request").  The original maintainer might accept some or all of your changes into their version; or they might discuss them with you in the conversation section.
   
   - OR maintain your own share your version with others and see what changes others suggest to you
   
The purpose of this repo is to develop policy documents and draft legislation collaboratively, with branching and related layers of detail.  This way people can go in different directions on the same policy document and later try to merge them into an agreed whole.  It is perhaps most interesting to develop compromise policy that contains elements from different perspectives.

Contributions welcome.

If working on the language of a model law, consider starting from an existing real-world law at https://stateinnovation.org/resource/resource/2016-01-18-2011-arizona-chapter-226 or a model bill at http://publicleadershipinstitute.org/model-bills/

Please keep discussions concrete and involved with specific changes you would like to see.  Ranting is understandable, but not here, because we want to keep this repo dedicated to the creation of policy language.
